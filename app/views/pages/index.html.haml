          was created during "Ship It Saturday", a one-day hack-a-thon organized by #{link_to 'Launch Academy', 'http://www.launchacademy.com'}. Coding started after breakfast and the site was deployed by dinnertime. Although some refactoring has taken place, the bulk of the work was completed in an 8-hour period.

          This site is currently in #{link_to 'open beta', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle'}, which means that it isn't finished yet. Everything works so far as I know,Â but you may encounter errors. I appreciate your patience and understanding as I get things ready for the full release.
